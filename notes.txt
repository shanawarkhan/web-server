Use below code for checking your directory before serving files from public folder
 console.log(__dirname); 




//Express Static for route for serving files from public folder
// If we do not specify '/' route , then the route provided in expressStatic will be made the default route




Specifying PORT throught the port variable so that we don't repeat ourselves
